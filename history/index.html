                    <p>Although not all of them were a part of the original group, Kevin Abstract, Ameer Vann, Joba, Matt Champion, and Merlyn Wood met as teenagers, as they all attended The Woodlands High School in Woodlands, Texas. In 2010, Abstract made
                        a post on the KanyeLive online forum (now known as KanyeToThe) asking if anyone wanted to form a band, to which over 30 users responded. After this AliveSinceForever was then formed, although the band only went active in 2012.
                        In 2013, AliveSinceForever released their debut EP album, The ASF EP. The lineup consisted of Abstract, Vann, Dom McLennon, Mic Kurb (later known as Rodney Tenor) and approximately 26 other members. At the end of 2014, AliveSinceForever
                        disbanded to rebrand as Brockhampton.</p>

                    debut, and their first performance since announcing Vann's departure. They debuted the track "Tonya", accompanied by guest vocalists Jazmine Sullivan, Ryan Beatty and Serpentwithfeet, as well as revealing the new title of their upcoming
